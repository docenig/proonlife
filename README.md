# PROON-LIFE
Run. Think. Shoot up heroin. Huff electrical ozone.
Welcome to **PROON-LIFE**, the first actual joke mod for Half-Life: Source. Born out of aggro desperation at SS:MM1:WTF not having a linux compatible client file, brebare your angus for the adventures of *Gordon Food Service "Realest Wigga" Freakman* as one experiment with prunes in a sci-fi laser kills the fucking universe under an autism supernova.

## GOALS:
- Altered story and map locations to make things more bizarre
- Replacement of convenient sounds
- Changed models for most, if not all enemy and friendly NPCs
- Changed models and sounds for player and enemy weaponry
- Fuse multiple maps of the original together to reduce load times and maximize haha funny joke potential
- Attempt porting into Source 2013 SDK in order to make things even worse
- New NPCs everywhere
- Make the whole universe forget garbage like Crack-Life exists
- Get AJollyWangcore, Accursed Farms, GmanLives and Civvie11 to make vids on it
- Become king of Vinesauce joke mod streams
- Make **PROON-LIFE 2** by the time of the paradigm shift in 2070

## Current Project People
- Enig (docenig, firestarter)
- AlphaKingAcid (gravymond, git starter)
- Bogie (BrokenPencil223, model man)

## Openings for employment and/or meme death in Black Mesa are avaiable in:
- Modeling (rig old animations onto models, make new NPCs or props, maybe even level detail props if we want to go full CSGO on this decrepit engine)
- Mapping (meme man cannot live on fusing rp_downtown_v4 into Surface Tension alone)
- Playtesting (we want to make you suffer through maps where entire walls are made of func_tank)

2019, valve pls fix
